description: "The Magician is a novel by British author W. Somerset Maugham, originally\
  \ published in 1908. In this tale, the magician Oliver Haddo, a caricature of Aleister\
  \ Crowley, attempts to create life. Crowley wrote a critique of this book under\
  \ the pen name Oliver Haddo, in which he accused Maugham of plagiarism.\nMaugham\
  \ wrote The Magician in London, after he had spent some time living in Paris, where\
  \ he met Aleister Crowley. The novel was later republished with a foreword by Maugham\
  \ entitled A Fragment of Autobiography.\nThe novel inspired a film of the same name\
  \ directed in 1926 by Rex Ingram.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
